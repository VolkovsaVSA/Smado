"By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages, or make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Sergei Volkov.\n\nSergei Volkov is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.\n\nThe Smado app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order to provide my Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that the Smado app won’t work properly or at all.\n\nYou should be aware that there are certain things that Sergei Volkov will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but Sergei Volkov cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.\n\nIf you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.\n\nAlong the same lines, Sergei Volkov cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, Sergei Volkov cannot accept responsibility.\n\nWith respect to Sergei Volkov’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. Sergei Volkov accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.\n\nAt some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on iOS – the requirements for system(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. Sergei Volkov does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the iOS version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.\n\nChanges to This Terms and Conditions\nI may update our Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on this page.\n\nThese terms and conditions are effective as of 2022-05-16\n\nContact Us\nIf you have any questions or suggestions about my Terms and Conditions, do not hesitate to contact me at smado@vsa.su.\n\n" = "通过下载或使用该应用程序，这些条款将自动适用于您——因此，您应确保在使用该应用程序之前仔细阅读它们。您不得以任何方式复制或修改应用程序、应用程序的任何部分或我们的商标。您不得尝试提取应用程序的源代码，也不应尝试将应用程序翻译成其他语言或制作衍生版本。该应用程序本身，以及与之相关的所有商标、版权、数据库权利和其他知识产权，仍属于谢尔盖沃尔科夫。\n\nSergei Volkov 致力于确保该应用程序尽可能有用和高效。因此，我们保留随时以任何理由对应用程序进行更改或对其服务收费的权利。我们绝不会向您收取应用程序或其服务的费用，除非您非常清楚您所支付的费用。\n\nSmado 应用程序存储和处理您提供给我们的个人数据，以便提供我的服务。您有责任保护您的手机和应用程序访问的安全。因此，我们建议您不要越狱或 root 手机，这是消除设备官方操作系统施加的软件限制和限制的过程。它可能使您的手机容易受到恶意软件/病毒/恶意程序的攻击，损害您手机的安全功能，这可能意味着 Smado 应用程序将无法正常运行或根本无法运行。\n\n您应该知道，Sergei Volkov 不会对某些事情负责。该应用程序的某些功能将要求该应用程序具有有效的互联网连接。连接可以是 Wi-Fi，也可以由您的移动网络提供商提供，但如果您无法访问 Wi-Fi，并且您没有任何你的数据限额还剩。\n\n如果您在有 Wi-Fi 的区域之外使用该应用程序，您应该记住，您与移动网络提供商的协议条款仍然适用。因此，您的移动提供商可能会在访问应用程序时向您收取连接期间的数据费用或其他第三方费用。在使用该应用程序时，您将承担任何此类费用，包括如果您在本国领土（即地区或国家）之外使用该应用程序而未关闭数据漫游的漫游数据费用。如果您不是使用该应用程序的设备的账单支付者，请注意，我们假定您已获得账单支付者的使用该应用程序的许可。\n\n同样，谢尔盖沃尔科夫不能总是对您使用该应用程序的方式负责，即您需要确保您的设备保持充电状态——如果电池电量耗尽并且您无法打开它以使用该服务，谢尔盖沃尔科夫不能承担责任。\n\n关于 Sergei Volkov 对您使用该应用程序的责任，当您使用该应用程序时，请务必记住，尽管我们努力确保它始终保持更新和正确，但我们确实依赖第三方向我们提供信息，以便我们将其提供给您。谢尔盖沃尔科夫对您因完全依赖应用程序的此功能而遭受的任何直接或间接损失不承担任何责任。\n\n在某些时候，我们可能希望更新应用程序。该应用程序目前在 iOS 上可用 - 系统要求（以及我们决定将应用程序的可用性扩展到的任何其他系统）可能会发生变化，如果您想继续使用该应用程序，则需要下载更新。 Sergei Volkov 不承诺它会始终更新应用程序以使其与您相关和/或与您设备上安装的 iOS 版本一起使用。但是，您承诺在向您提供应用程序时始终接受更新，我们也可能希望停止提供该应用程序，并可随时终止使用该应用程序，而无需向您发出终止通知。除非我们另行通知您，否则在任何终止时，(a) 在这些条款中授予您的权利和许可将终止； (b) 您必须停止使用该应用程序，并（如果需要）将其从您的设备中删除。\n\n本条款和条件的更改\n我可能会不时更新我们的条款和条件。因此，建议您定期查看此页面以了解任何更改。我将通过在此页面上发布新的条款和条件来通知您任何更改。\n\n这些条款和条件自 2022-05-16 起生效\n\n联系我们\n如果您对我的条款和条件有任何疑问或建议，请随时通过 smado@vsa.su 与我联系。";
